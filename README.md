## Problem Statement
The Bike Buyers Dataset sourced from Kaggle provides comprehensive data on customers across Europe, North America, and the Pacific region. With this dataset, our objective is to extract valuable insights to inform business strategies and decision-making processes. Leveraging Microsoft Excel, we aim to construct a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key metrics, such as customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and geographic distribution. By analyzing this data, we seek to uncover trends, identify potential market opportunities, and optimize marketing efforts to better cater to the diverse needs of our target audience across these regions.

Middle Age: Individuals below 31 years old.
Adolescents: Customers aged between 31 and 50 years old.
Old: Individuals aged 50 years and above.
